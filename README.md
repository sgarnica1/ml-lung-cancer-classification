# Deep Learning Model for Lung Cancer Classification
This is a depp learning model for lung cancer images classification trained with a dataset retrieved from Kaggle and originally published in arXiv, a free distribution service and open-source achive. 

## Dataset
The original dataset was published by arXiv.org and consists of 25,000 images with 5 different classes of 5,000 images each and two main subclasses: colon and lung images. 

For this project, only the **lung images** where used. The dataset for lung images contains the following classes with 5,000 images each:
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma 
- Adenocarcinomas
- Bening lung tissues

All images are 768 x 769 pixels in size and in jpeg format.
